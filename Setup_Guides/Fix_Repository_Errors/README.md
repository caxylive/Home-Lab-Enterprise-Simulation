The errors you're encountering indicate an issue with the Proxmox Enterprise repository, as it requires a valid subscription for access. Since you appear to be using the free edition of Proxmox without a subscription, you should disable the enterprise repositories and enable the free, no-subscription repository instead.
Steps to Fix the Repository Errors:

# Steps to Fix the Repository Erros:

---

## 1. Disable Proxmox Enterprise Repositories:

* Edit the `pve-enterprise.list` file:
  ```Bash
  sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pve-enterprise.list
  ```

* Comment out the existing enterprise repository line by adding a `#` at the beginning:
  ```Bash
  #deb https://enterprise.proxmox.com/debian/pve bookworm pve-enterprise
  ```

* Save and exit (`CTRL + O`, `Enter`, `CTRL + X`).

---

## 2. Enable the No-Subscription Repository:

* Add the no-subscription repository:
  ```Bash
  echo "deb http://download.proxmox.com/debian/pve bookworm pve-no-subscription" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pve-no-subscription.list
  ```

* This repository provides updates for the free edition of Proxmox.

---

## 3. Update the Package List:

* Refresh your repositories to ensure they are working correctly:
  ```Bash
  apt update
  ```

---

## 4. Optional: Remove the Ceph Repository (if not needed):

* If you're not using Ceph, you can disable its repository as well:
  ```Bash
  nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ceph.list
  ```

* Comment out the Ceph repository line by adding a `#` at the beginning, then save and exit.

---

## 5. (Optional) Add a Community Ceph Repository
If you're actively using Ceph and want updates, you can add the Ceph community repository instead:

* Add the Ceph community repository:
  ```Bash
  echo "deb http://download.ceph.com/debian-quincy/ bookworm main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ceph-community.list
  ```

* Import the Ceph community repository key:
  ```Bash
  wget -q -O- 'https://download.ceph.com/keys/release.asc' | apt-key add -
  ```

## 6. Update the Package List
