## üìå Overview
This project documents my journey in building a **home lab** that simulates a real-world (small-medium business) **enterprise IT environment**. It includes detailed instructions for hardware setup, software installations, network configurations, and hands-on cybersecurity practices. The goal is to gain **hands-on experience** with:
- **System Administration** (Windows Server, Active Directory, DNS, DHCP, File Sharing)
- **Networking** (pfSense Firewall, VPN, GNS3 Network Simulations)
- **Cybersecurity** (SIEM, IDS/IPS, Penetration Testing with Kali Linux & Metasploitable)
- **DevOps & Virtualization** (Proxmox, Docker, Web & Database Servers)

## My Hardware
- **Laptop**
    - PM1: Repurposed laptop with Intel Core i7-1260P, 16GB RAM, and two 1TB SSDs.
    - 
- **Router**: I will **NOT** mention my router brand and model for security reasons (each model has their own unique **vulnerabilities** that hackers can **exploit** to gain access to your system)

- **Cables**: RJ45 (Cat 6a)

- **Peripherals**:
    - USB to Ethernet: to connect machine to router.
    - WiFi Adapter ([TP-Link TL-WN722N](https://www.tp-link.com/ph/home-networking/adapter/tl-wn722n/) supports **monitoring mode** and **packet injection**)

- **Backups**: external storage for backing up important files, ISOs, and software. Please see below for essential ISOs and softwares.

## üîß Setup Process and Documentation
1. **Backup** files and create **[bootable drives](https://github.com/caxylive/Common-Commands/blob/main/linux%20terminal/bootable_usb.md)** (my tools of choices are **dd**, **Ventoy** and **Rufus**). Refer **[here](https://github.com/caxylive/Common-Commands/blob/main/cmd_scripts/batch_copy_files.bat)** for useful scripts for batch copying files.
2. **[Install Proxmox VE](Setup_Guides/Proxmox_Install.md)** on the host machine.
    a. [Modify logind.conf](https://github.com/caxylive/Home-Lab-Enterprise-Simulation/blob/main/Setup_Guides/Prevent_Shutdown_When_Lid_Closed/README.md) so that the laptop stays powered on even when the lid is shut.
    b. Enable WOL (Wake-On-Lan) to remotely power on machine.
4. **[Create and configure VMs](Setup_Guides/VM_Configuration.md)** with allocated resources.
5. **[Set up core services](Setup_Guides/Server_Configuration)** (Active Directory, DNS, DHCP, File Server, etc.).
6. **Secure the network** with **pfSense [firewall](Setup_Guides/Firewall_Configuration.md) & [VPN](Setup_Guides/VPN_Configuration)**.
7. **Deploy cybersecurity tools** (SIEM, IDS/IPS, Pentesting tools): Wazuh, Suricata, etc.
8. **Simulate the Network** with [GNS3](Setup_Guides/GNS3.md)
9. **Simulate enterprise applications** (Web server, Database, Email, Docker apps).
10. **Perform security testing** with [Kali Linux](Security/Kali_Pentest) & [Metasploitable](Security/Metasploit).
